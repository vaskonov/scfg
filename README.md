Synchronous Context Free Grammar (SCFG) in Node.js. 

SCFG are a type of formal grammar designed for use in transfer-based machine translation. Rules in these grammars apply to two languages at the same time, capturing grammatical structures that are each other's translations. The repository contains a grammar to develop the Natural Language Understanding (NLG) component of the dialogue system (DS), where the source language is the semantic language of the DS, and the destination language is the natural language.
